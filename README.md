# FizzBuzz

The problem, known as the “Fizz Buzz” test, consists of writing a code (in any programming language) that performs the following task:

Write a program that displays on the screen the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing the multiples of 3 with the word “fizz”,
the multiples of 5 with “buzz” and the multiples of both, that is, the multiples of 3 and 5 (or 15), with the word “fizzbuzz”.
